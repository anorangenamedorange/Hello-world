# Hello-world
The starting of my another life

Hello there
However I know that nobody would read this .)
I am just a new employee at a bank doing some basic works like setting the files.
At this moment, I start learning how to use Github while i have nothing to do during my work hours.
I am now considering both my future and work when i started my first work cause now i cannot see my future.
Anyway, just have a try.
